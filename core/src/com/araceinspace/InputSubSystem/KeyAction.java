/**
 * Created by Isaac Assegai on 7/10/17.
 * In reality completely duplicating a play behaviour exactly is actually quite hard.
 * The physics simulation needs to be completely deterministic, no matter what is going on,
 * what time it is, what machine you are playing on. Everything needs to be repeated EXACTLY.
 * This doesnâ€™t work. So instead of relying on complete determinism, we are going to try to keep
 * things close, but if they get out of whack, we will be able to reset them using a KeyAction.
 * A KeyAction will only be generated once every X amount of Actions.
